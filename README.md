# sway-config
![Sway 0.13.0 with status_command being provided by i3status.py](https://fusion809.github.io/images/Sway/Sway-0.13.0-27-June-2017-Python.png)
This repository contains my Sway configs, they are mostly borrowed from my [i3 configs](https://github.com/fusion809/i3-configs) so if you want more details (like keybindings) go there.
